Welcome to my final project page Thanaphan Thapthimhin tt25@illinois.edu
For IS597-MLC: Machine Learning Pipelines Using Cloud-Based Platforms Summer 2024


There are two models: Gradient Boosting basic and XGBoosting power You as the rater please run both of them to see the results. They are not linked or called by each other. They are separate. My final project is to compare the results between the two. Please read my .pdf file in the Canvas page for the full final project paper. Make sure you have this dataset "america_north.Canada.eng.1" ready. The file is 3.7 GB and cannot be uploaded to GitHub (it only allows 25 MB max). Please download the dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4ZKgfUXFEnxGlGDkLKQMorRL2UzV1uJ/view?usp=sharing
I also uploaded the dataset to the Final Project Deliverables of this course.
In case the jupyter notebooks fail to work, I also attach the .py codes with the same names there as well.
Thank you and have a good day.
Thanaphan
